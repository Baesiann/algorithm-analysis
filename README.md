### Input data requirements
Creation of arrays - plan to use JSON organized arrays to feed into separate sorting algorithms
Requires:
- Variable input size
- Random
- Nearly sorted
- Reverse
- Duplicate heavy

### Sorting Algorithm Requirements
Sorting Algorithm must handle edge cases
- Empty Lists
- Single-Element Lists
- Large Datasets
Gathering of metrics
- Execution Time
- Number of element comparisons
- Number of swaps
- Number of recursive calls
